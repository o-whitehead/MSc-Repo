Various AI/ML applications I have coded in my spare time

This includes:

  A set of building block classes and functions that allow for multiple applications, here they have been used to:
    Create an XOR gate.
    Solve the MNIST data set using a convolutional neural network (for 0 and 1s only due to hardware limitations).
  
  A Deep Q-Learning approach to teach an agent to play Mario via computer vision.

  A 3 layer network that solves the MNIST set without dedicated ML libraries, just numpy.
